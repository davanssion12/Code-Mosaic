Factors such as the global talent shortage, the rise of remote work, and technological innovation all contributed to this transformation. Some key trends during this period include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Increased Use of Job Boards:</strong> Platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor became dominant players in recruitment, making it easier for employers to connect with potential candidates.</li> <li><strong>AI and Automation in Hiring:</strong> AI-driven tools were increasingly integrated to assist in candidate screening, interview scheduling, and skills assessments, improving recruitment efficiency.</li> <li><strong>Mobile Recruiting:</strong> The mobile recruitment trend grew as more candidates started searching for jobs through smartphones, leading to the development of mobile-friendly job portals.</li> <li><strong>Remote Work Influence:</strong> The rise of remote work, especially post-2020, expanded the global talent pool, and companies embraced more diverse recruitment strategies.</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h2>Forecast for Online Recruitment from 2023 to 2033</h2> <p>The outlook for online recruitment from 2023 to 2033 is set to be shaped by several long-term trends and technological advancements.
